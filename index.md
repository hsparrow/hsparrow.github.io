## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="files/hang.JPG">

Hi! I am a second-year graduate student in Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University. Before CMU, I got a B.Sc. in Engineering from the Renmin University of China, where I majored in Information Systems and Management. I worked at Gas Turbine Establishment of China as an aero-engineer, working on testing and processing aero-dynamics and aero-acoustic signals. Dealing with different text dominant tasks these years has cultivated my interest in natural language processing. More specificly, I'm interested in building machine learning and deep learning models to understand human language.
