## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="files/hang.JPG">

Hi! I am a second-year graduate student in Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University. Before CMU, I got a B.Sc. in Engineering from Renmin University of China, where I majored in Information Systems and Management. 

I have wide interest in natural language processing tasks. More specificly, I'm interested in building machine learning and deep learning models to understand human language.
